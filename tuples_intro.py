# tuple data structure
# tuple can store any data type 
# most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update
# date inside tuple

exmaple = ('one', 'two', 'three')
#  no appned, no insert , no pop , no remove

# days = ('monday', 'tuesday')
# tuple are faster than lists

# methods 
# count, index 
# len function
# print(exmaple[:2])   
# exmaple[0] = 1
print(exmaple)
